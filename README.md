# **Ray Tracer**  

This project is a fully functional **Ray Tracer** written from scratch in **C++**. It was developed for a school assignment to explore rendering concepts such as ray propagation, reflections, and lighting interactions in a 3D scene.  

---

## 🎯 **Project Overview**  

The Ray Tracer can:  
- Populate scenes with **triangles** and **spheres**.  
- Cast rays that interact with objects based on their **diffuse**, **specular**, and **glossy** properties.  
- Simulate **reflections** and ray bouncing.  
- Integrate **outside lighting** to illuminate the scene realistically.

## ⚙️ **Features**  

- **Ray Casting**: Rays are cast into the scene to determine object intersections.  
- **Reflections**: Supports ray bouncing for reflective surfaces.  
- **Lighting**: Simulates diffuse and specular lighting based on external light sources.  
- **Gloss and Material Properties**: Objects react to light based on defined material attributes (diffuse, specular, gloss).  
- **Scene Population**: Supports two primary shapes: **Triangles** and **Spheres**.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**  

- **C++**: Core programming language.  
- **Custom Ray Tracing Algorithm**: No external libraries were used.  

---

## 🚀 **Future Improvements**  

While the core functionality is complete, the following features could be added for enhancement:  
- **Shaders**: Add shading techniques for more advanced rendering.  
- **Multiple Refractions**: Support for transparent objects with ray refraction.  
- **Texture Mapping**: Apply textures to objects.  
- **Bump Mapping**: Simulate surface details for greater realism.

## 📚 **What I Learned**  

This project provided hands-on experience with:  
- The mathematics of **ray tracing** and 3D graphics.  
- Implementing material properties like **diffuse**, **specular**, and **gloss** lighting.  
- Managing recursive ray bounces for **reflections**.  
- Optimizing intersections with **triangles** and **spheres** in 3D space.
